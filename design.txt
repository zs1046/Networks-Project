This program simulates distance vector routing using parallel arrays.
Every node is only aware of its immediate neighbors and only gets the 
whole picuture after rounds of  sending DV packets to said neighbors and updating 
routing tables when necessary. DV packets include the source node and the list of
node-costs pairs for what that node knows about the network.
Routing table entries (destination, cost, next hop), neighbor attributes (name, cost), 
and DV packets (destination, cost) were all made up of arrays in which the indices correlated to one another. 
The simulator calls three events. One is to send a DV packet to a neighbor, another to process a DV packet that was received, 
and an event to forward data packets to a destination. Sending a DV packet and forwarding a data packet used very similar functions. The only main
difference being that sending a DV packet only required one hop every time. Forwarding a data packet required setting up multiple hops.
The Results page provides the Routing Table after convergence. It also shows
how many round it took to converge and what was the last node to converge in each
network.
